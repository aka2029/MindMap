# Mind Mapping Application

An effective way to capture your thoughts, without having the worry to forget them.

In this project i've uses babel webpack to convert Es6 modules to Es5, so as to make sure that it runs on all browsers.

I hope you like it :)

[

1. npm install - to install the dependencies ie node_modules
2. npm build - compile and build
3. npm start - to run in the browser

   ]

Here, the important thing to remember is that we are not including the app.js file but are including the app.bundle.js file
because this is the file that has the converted version(ie Es5 and not Es6)
